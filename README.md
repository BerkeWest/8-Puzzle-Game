# 8-Puzzle-Game
This is a 8 Puzzle game I edited for my Programming Studio class. In this project, I added misplaced tiles and manhattan distance heuristic algorithms to solve the game automatically. I also made some adjustments to the game.

# What is the purpose of this game
In this game, you get a randomly arranged board with tiles from 1 to 8 and an empty tile. Your goal is to switch the empty tile with others and rearrange the board to fit the goal state. The goal state is the board arranged in increasing order and empty tile in the right bottom position.

# How to play the game
When you launch the game, the console prints all the key bindings you can use.
You can change the empty tile's position using the arrow keys. 
You can also call the misplaced tiles algorithm or manhattan distance algorithm at any time using H for misplaced tiles and M for manhattan distance to automatically solve your board.
You can also get a random new board using R.
If you want a guaranteed unsolvable board you can press F, or if you want a guaranteed solvable board you can press G.
